## v1.0 — Phase 4: Area 2 "the Cinder Reach" + Web Audio + game-over/title/credits polish

**Date:** 2026-05-17. **Tag:** `v1.0` on `main`. **Pages:** [genishs.github.io/wonderboy](https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/).

v1.0 ships the final-quartile content: a second playable area, full audio integration, and the title/game-over/credits polish that closes the run.

### Highlights

1. **Area 2 — the Cinder Reach.** Reed climbs out of the Old Threshold canopy glade up an old switchback path onto a wind-scoured upland. Four stages (Switchback → Beacon Walk → Knifing → Reignward) with original tilesets, palettes, and 12 new parallax SVGs.
2. **Three new enemies:** **Cinderwisp** (windborne sine-drifter), **Quarrywight** (armored stone walker, first multi-hit enemy in the run — 2 hatchets to kill, first hit chips armor), **Skyhook** (cliff-perched dropper with perch/fall/walk FSM).
3. **Boss — the Reignwarden.** Standing humanoid colossus posted on a beacon-tower pedestal. HP 9, three-cinder volley attack that spawns transient ember-pit hazards on the arena floor for ~2 sec each. Same Warden-shape FSM as the Bracken Warden; a deliberate intra-project parallel.
4. **Two new pickups:** **Sunpear** (+50 vitality, brightest food in the run), **Flintchip** (transient buff — raises the on-screen hatchet cap from 2 to 3 for 10 sec; clears on stage transition).
5. **Web Audio integration.** Five procedural BGM tracks (title Lydian / area1 unchanged / area2 Phrygian / boss-fight Dorian / game-over chromatic descent) with multi-voice harmony, plus a C-major area-cleared stinger. 22 SFX events wired across HeroController, HatchetSystem, CombatSystem, HuskSystem, ItemSystem, Phase2EnemyAI, BossSystem, AreaManager, StateManager. State-driven BGM dispatcher and per-state mix transitions (BGM gain ramps to 0.55 on title / 0.40 on boss-fight / 0.35 on game-over).
6. **CREDITS state (new).** Defeating the Reignwarden routes the run through a scrolling credits screen with original "in the spirit of 1986/87 platformers" text — no copyrighted titles referenced. Any input restarts a fresh Area 1 run.
7. **Title polish.** On-screen label now reads **"WONDER BOY TRIBUTE / The Mossline Path"** (matches repo README; clearer tribute posture, no trademark reproduction).
8. **Game-over polish.** Bilingual continue prompt unchanged; now also shows the current Area-Stage (e.g., "Area 2 — Stage 2-3") in dim gray so the player can read where they fell.

### What changed (PRs)

- **#38** — story-lead: Phase 4 briefs `phase4-area2-cast` + `phase4-audio` (EN+KO each, ~1,600 LoC of design spec).
- **#39** — design-lead: Area 2 assets — 7 sprites + 4 tilesets + 12 parallax SVGs (+4,007 LoC of original art data).
- **#40** — dev-lead: AudioManager extension, Area 2 stage tree, area-aware AreaManager / TileCache / ParallaxBackground, Reignwarden boss, cinder volley + ember-pit hazards, Sunpear + Flintchip ItemSystem, CREDITS state, title/game-over polish (+2,013 LoC of engine code).
- **#41** — release-master: Area 2 asset wiring in `game.js` (sprite + tile imports + cache loads) and v1.0 release notes.

### Quartile state

- v1.0 ships the **full quartile checklist**: full content (2 playable areas with bosses) + game-over/continue + polish + verified mobile controls (carried from v0.75.1).
- Six of the seven README-promised areas are left for post-1.0 expansion. The v1.0 game loop is a complete demo: Area 1 → Bracken Warden → Area 2 → Reignwarden → credits → restart.
- Procedural Web Audio means **zero binary audio assets** in the repo; the same approach we used for sprites and tiles is now uniform across all media.

### Known limitations

- Area 2 stages 2-2, 2-3, 2-4 ship as single-round stubs (vs. brief's full 4-round-per-stage spec). Stage 2-1 has the full 4 rounds. Future patches can extend the inner rounds.
- Cinderwisp's Stage 2-3 wind-modulation bump (brief spec'd a 25 % speed/amplitude increase) is not yet applied; ships with base values.
- No in-browser smoke run was performed before tag (the harness running the autonomous build does not have a Node-on-PATH for `npx serve`). CI's `node --check` validated syntax across all changed `.js`; live URL is the first real-runtime gate.

## v0.75.1 — Phase 3 patch: hero scale + fruits + Threadshade + husk burst + stage parallax + boss spawn + Area loop + touch controls

**Released:** 2026-05-14 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.75.1` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

User feedback after browser-testing v0.75 surfaced 6 issues + a follow-up mobile-controls ask. v0.75.1 lands all of them across four PRs.

### Fixes (per user feedback item)

1. **Hero looked "too big for the world."** Reed was rebuilt at 24×36 in v0.75 but his hitbox + hatchet spawn stayed at the 16×24 footprint. Solution: `sprite.scale 3 → 2` in StageManager. Same hero anims, same hitbox, just rendered smaller. Anchor (12, 35) at scale 2 lands feet flush at the hitbox bottom; no anchor nudge needed.
2. **Fruit pickups (dewplum + amberfig) restore vitality.** Two original-named fruits with distinct restore amounts:
   - **dewplum** (14×14, 2-frame shimmer @ 4 fps) — common, +20 vitality. 1 per stage typical.
   - **amberfig** (18×18, 3-frame brighter glow @ 4 fps, reuses boss-sigil `#fff2c0` for the peak) — rare, +50 vitality. 1 per stage typical.
   - New `src/mechanics/ItemSystem.js` handles pickup contact. Placement specifies in stage-specific round files. ~+90 vitality possible per stage full-collect.
3. **Dawn-husk burst animation + shell-fragment particles.** Existing dawn-husk gets a new `burst` animation (3 frames @ 8 fps; egg halves separate explosively with amber flash). At the burst frame, HuskSystem spawns 3 husk-shell entities (8×8 tumbling fragments) with random `vx ±4`, `vy −5 to −3`, gravity 0.45, 90-frame lifetime. Shells are pure visual particles — no collision, no damage. New `assets/sprites/item-husk-shell.js`.
4. **Per-stage parallax SVG backgrounds.** 9 new SVGs ship (Stage 2 shore × 3, Stage 3 cave × 3, Stage 4 dark forest × 3). ParallaxBackground.setStage(n) swaps active layers on stage transition (called from AreaManager). Stage 1 keeps the original forest parallax.
5. **Threadshade enemy** — original-named vertical-only spider. 18×24 sprite (2 drift + 2 dead frames @ 6 fps). Fixed x-column, sine vertical motion (amplitude 1.5 tiles, frequency 0.04 rad/frame). 1-hit-kill on hero contact / 1-hit kill from hatchet. Spawn placement: Stage 2 = 1 (round 2-3), Stage 3 = 2 (3-2, 3-4), Stage 4 = 2 (4-2, 4-3). Total 5 across Area 1.
6. **Mossplodder spawn audit + bug fix.** Investigation found one real bug: round-1-2's mossplodder at col 50 sat inside the 3-tile gap (cols 50-52) and fell through on frame 1 — never visible. Moved to col 55 on post-gap flat. All other rounds verified spawning correctly. User's "only bees show" perception was partially true because Mossplodders crawl slowly at 0.7 px/frame on a small sprite while Hummerwings buzz at chest height — visibility is asymmetric.
7. **Boss spawn-Y bug fix.** Old formula `bossY = floorRow*TILE − h + TILE` placed feet one full tile BELOW the arena floor. Fixed by dropping the spurious `+ TILE`. Boss feet now flush at `tf.y + tf.h = floorRow*TILE`.
8. **Area-Cleared loop** — after Bracken Warden death + Area-Cleared overlay, any directional/jump/attack/sprint input now resets to Area 1 Stage 1 with lives=3, vitality=max, `pl.armed=false`. New `state.dismissAreaCleared()` mirrors `continueRun()`. Until Area 2 ships, the game loops fresh at Stage 1.
9. **Mobile touch controls** (user follow-up). Visible semi-transparent buttons drawn on canvas:
   - `←` at (20, 460, 80×80), `→` at (120, 460, 80×80), `Z` at (568, 460, 80×80), `X` at (668, 460, 80×80).
   - Multi-touch supported: hold `→` with one finger and tap `Z` or hold `X` with another = run + jump + sprint together. Per-touch identifier tracking + refcount-style release.
   - Idle alpha 0.25; pressed alpha 0.5 with sigil-amber fill. Works alongside keyboard (`_keys` map shared).

### Files touched (across all v0.75.1 PRs)

- New systems: `src/mechanics/ItemSystem.js`
- Modified: `src/levels/{AreaManager, StageManager}.js` (hero scale, fruit + Threadshade spawns, stage parallax swap, Area-Cleared dismiss); `src/mechanics/{HuskSystem, Phase2EnemyAI, CombatSystem, BossSystem, HeroController}.js`; `src/graphics/{Renderer, ParallaxBackground}.js`; `src/core/{InputHandler, GameLoop, StateManager}.js`; `src/config/PhaseThreeTunables.js`; `game.js`; all v0.75 round files for spawn placements.
- New design: `assets/sprites/{item-dewplum, item-amberfig, item-husk-shell, enemy-threadshade}.js` + `item-dawn-husk.js` extended; 9 stage parallax SVGs.
- Updated docs: README + README.ko (Controls + Mobile section); phase3 brief Changelogs; palette-v0.75.1 EN+KO; 6 new preview docs.

### What did NOT change

- Cast identity (Reed Bramblestep, Mossplodder, Hummerwing, dawn-husk, Bracken Warden, moss-pulse, Mossline Path, etc.).
- v0.75's 4-stage area structure, mile-marker overlay system, stage-exit / cairn triggers, boss FSM topology.
- All v0.50.x semantics (3 lives, dying FSM, sprint, slope step-up, rock stumble, GAME OVER continue).
- CI workflow, bilingual policy, tag scheme.

### Known limitations carried to v1.0

- Area 2 still not built (Area-Cleared loops back to Stage 1).
- No audio (deferred to v1.0).
- No in-browser smoke ran during dev (Node unavailable); static checks PASS, live URL is the first real run.
- Mobile touch buttons always drawn (no device-type detection); could hide on desktop in a polish patch.
- Stage 4 right-wall fallback color still TILE_COLORS[6] brown (carried from v0.75; design follow-up).

### Tribute posture

All v0.75.1 additions — dewplum, amberfig, Threadshade, husk-shell, the 9 stage-specific parallax SVGs, the mobile touch UI — are original to this project. The mechanic categories (fruit pickups, vertical-only spider enemy, particle effects, mobile touch controls) are universal action-platformer/mobile-game conventions executed with original art and original code. No reproduction of copyrighted material.

## v0.75 — Phase 3: Area 1 = 4 stages + Bracken Warden boss + hero anim rebuild

**Released:** 2026-05-13 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.75` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

Third quartile milestone. Area 1 grows from one continuous 224-column stage to a **4-stage Area** (forest → beach/shore → cave → dark forest), each with its own 4 rounds + mile-marker overlays, connected by `stage_exit` tile transitions. Stage 4 ends with the **Bracken Warden** boss fight in a camera-locked arena. Reed's sprite is rebuilt at higher resolution (24×36) with slower, more grounded animation cadence to address v0.50.2's "looks like dancing" feedback.

### What's playable

- **Area 1 — "The Mossline Path"**, expanded to 4 stages:
  - **Stage 1** (forest, unchanged) — the existing Mossline Path content from v0.50.x. 4 rounds (1-1 to 1-4) ending in `stage_exit` instead of cairn.
  - **Stage 2** (beach/shore) — 4 rounds (2-1 to 2-4). Sun-warmed sand surface, sea-foam tide-line, `water_gap` 1-hit-kill water at gaps.
  - **Stage 3** (cave) — 4 rounds (3-1 to 3-4). Deeper-greens-cooled-by-mineral palette. `crystal_vein` 1-hit-kill animated hazard (Stage 1's fire repurposed). Low-ceiling crawl section in 3-1 as the signature beat.
  - **Stage 4** (dark forest) — 4 rounds (4-1 to 4-4) + boss arena. Deep blue-green canopy, violet undertones, `moonlight_streak` decorative tiles in 4-4 leading the eye to the boss.
- **Stage transitions** — crossing a `stage_exit` tile triggers a 195-frame stage-transition ritual (input lock 30 / fade-out 45 / hold + bilingual overlay "Stage N / 스테이지 N" 75 / fade-in 45) then loads next stage. Vitality refills. Lives + score + `pl.armed` all carry.
- **Bracken Warden boss fight** — moss-covered stone-and-bracken guardian at the back of a 12×11 dark-forest clearing. FSM: idle → windup (45 f telegraph; chest sigil flares) → attack (slam, spawns moss-pulse projectile at sub-frame 12) → recover (90 f). HP 6 (hatchet hits). Hatchet/moss-pulse mutual despawn on overlap.
- **moss-pulse projectile** — boss-spawned shockwave entity. Travels left at walk speed (3.5 px/frame). Sprint outruns it; hatchet despawns it. 1-hit-kill on hero contact.
- **Boss arena camera lock** — when Reed crosses the boss-trigger column in Round 4-4, camera locks at the arena entry and boss spawns. Reed cannot retreat past the lock-left. Right wall solid.
- **HP bar HUD during boss fight** — 6 pip bar at top-center under vitality bar, "BRACKEN WARDEN" title above. Sigil-amber filled / velvet-shadow empty.
- **Area cleared overlay** — after boss death (60-f death anim + 60-f celebratory beat), shows bilingual "Area 1 cleared — the path continues. / Area 1 클리어 — 길은 이어진다." Any input dismisses to title. Terminal (Area 2 not built; deferred to a future quartile).
- **Hero sprite rebuild** — 24×36 art-pixels (was 16×24), anchor (12, 35). META.animFps slowed across the board (idle 3 fps, walk 5 fps, sprint 8 fps, etc.) so the silhouette reads as grounded motion rather than rapid cycling. Walk = ~1.25 strides/sec, sprint = 2 strides/sec at the actual physics speeds.
- **Lives system + all v0.50.2 semantics** preserved (vitality = one life, 3 lives per Area; mile-marker checkpoints; dying FSM with knockback; GAME OVER unlimited continue → returns to Area 1 Stage 1 start with refilled lives; sprint via X-held; rock stumble; slope step-up).

### Engine additions / changes

- **New modules**: `src/levels/AreaManager.js`, `src/levels/area1/stage{2,3,4}/index.js` + `round-{N}-{1..4}.js` (12 new round modules), `src/mechanics/BossSystem.js`, `src/mechanics/StageTransitionSystem.js`, `src/config/PhaseThreeTunables.js`.
- **Major rewrites**: `src/levels/StageManager.js` (now handles ONE stage's lifecycle; multi-stage flow moved to AreaManager), `src/levels/area1/index.js` (now delegates to per-stage builders), `src/graphics/TileCache.js` (loads all 4 tilesets at init; active palette swaps on stage transition), `src/mechanics/{TriggerSystem, CombatSystem, HeroController}.js`, `src/graphics/Renderer.js` (boss HP bar, stage-transition overlay, area-cleared overlay).
- **TileMap new types**: `WATER_GAP` (Stage 2 hazard), `CRYSTAL_VEIN` (Stage 3 hazard, animated), `MOONLIGHT_STREAK` (Stage 4 decoration, animated), `STAGE_EXIT` (mid-stage transition trigger), `BOSS_TRIGGER` (boss arena entry trigger). `tile.isFatal` flag generalizes `tile.isFire` across all hazard tiles.
- **GAME_STATES** added: `STAGE_TRANSITION`, `BOSS_FIGHT`, `AREA_CLEARED`.
- **ECS** field additions on `player`: none new for v0.75 (uses v0.50.2's `dyingFrames`, `stumbleFrames`, etc.). New `boss` component on the Bracken Warden entity (state, hp, maxHp, stateTimer, facingRight).
- **CI required-files list** extended in `.github/workflows/pr-feature-to-develop.yml` with the new src files.

### Known limitations carried to v1.0 backlog

- Stage 4's right-wall column at the boss arena uses the renderer's `TILE_COLORS[6]` brown fallback instead of an art-tile; visually quiet, but Design can ship a dark-forest wall tile in a follow-up.
- Inside Stages 2/3/4, mile-marker overlays still read "Round 1/2/3/4" (matches the v0.50.2 convention preserved by the plan); could be re-themed as "Round 2-3" etc. for clarity in a polish patch.
- **No in-browser smoke ran during dev** — Node unavailable on the dev workstation. Static analysis (paren/brace balance + import resolution) PASS on all 49 changed JS files; round/stage builder simulation PASS on all 4 stages. **Live URL post-deploy is the first real run.**
- Area 2 not yet built. The area-cleared overlay is intentionally terminal.
- Audio integration deferred to v1.0 (still no BGM / SFX).
- Parallax: existing forest 3-layer parallax used in all stages (no per-stage parallax variation yet; design could ship per-stage bg modules in a follow-up).

### PRs in this quartile

- #26 `story(phase3): Area 1 expansion — 4 stages (forest/cave/water/ruin) + boss (EN+KO)` (themes later corrected by #28)
- #27 `design(phase3): shore + cave + dark-forest tilesets + Bracken Warden boss + moss-pulse (+ hero rebuild + theme remap absorbed)`
- #28 `story(phase3-correction): theme remap — Stage 2 beach / Stage 3 cave / Stage 4 dark forest (EN+KO)`
- #29 `dev(v0.75): Phase 3 — multi-stage Area 1 + Bracken Warden boss + hero anim wire`
- next: `chore(release): v0.75 release notes` (this PR family)
- next: `release(v0.75): Phase 3 quartile merge` (the develop→main merge)

### Tribute posture

All v0.75 characters, sprites, world fiction, level layouts, and boss design are original to this project. The Bracken Warden, moss-pulse, the Stage 2/3/4 themes (executed with our own palette/silhouette decisions), and the dark-forest arena composition are coined for this work. Generic action-platformer conventions (multi-stage areas, end-of-area boss fights, camera-lock arenas) are universal. No reproduction of copyrighted material.

## v0.50.2 — Phase 2 patch: jitter fix + slope step-up + new anims + mile-marker shift + death FSM + rock stumble

**Released:** 2026-05-10 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.50.2` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

User feedback after browser-testing v0.50.1 surfaced six issues. v0.50.2 lands all six in a design + dev pair.

### Fixes

- **Standing-still jitter eliminated.** Root cause: `CollisionSystem` flat-bottom-sweep used strict `footY > tileTop`, missing the equality case. Each frame Reed's `ph.onGround` was reset to false, gravity dropped him 0.55 px, then snap re-pulled — visible 1-px oscillation. Fix: change to `>=`. One-character delta.
- **New hero animations.** `sprint` (4 fr @ 12 fps), `sprint_armed` (4 fr @ 12 fps), `stumble` (3 fr @ 8 fps, shared armed/unarmed), refined `death` (4 fr @ 8 fps — knockback rise → airborne tilt → ground impact → settle). Legacy `dead` aliased to the last death frame so existing fallbacks resolve. Idle stays as a 3-frame breath at 4 fps (no longer needs to be static now that the jitter is gone).
- **Slope step-up.** `CollisionSystem.resolveTiles` now auto-steps the hero up to a flat-tile top when blocked by ≤18 px of rise (covers slope→flat seam pixel rounding). Hero-only via `isHero` arg; Mossplodder still bumps walls cleanly. Walking up slopes with arrow keys alone now works without jumping.
- **Mile-marker positions shifted to round STARTS** (per user request "팻말은 라운드 시작에"):
  - Round 1-1 → `mile_1` at col 3 (right after spawn) — overlay "Round 1 / 라운드 1"
  - Round 1-2 → `mile_2` at col 50 (round-relative col 2 + offset 48)
  - Round 1-3 → `mile_3` at col 114
  - Round 1-4 → `mile_4` at col 162 (NEW tile shipped in design PR #22)
  - End-of-stage cairn unchanged (still triggers Stage Cleared)
  - StageManager overlay mapping updated: `mile_N` fires "Round N" overlay; `lastCheckpointCol = mile_N.col + 1` so respawn is just past the marker entering the announced round.
- **Death = knockback + animation + delayed respawn.** `state.killHero(player)` in Phase 2 routes through new `state.beginDying(player)` instead of immediate life decrement. Knockback velocity (vx ±5, vy −6) applied; `pl.dyingFrames = 45` timer; HeroController plays the new `death` anim while the timer decrements. On 1→0 edge, HeroController calls `state.loseLife()` which respawns at the latest passed mile-marker (with `pl.armed` preserved).
- **GAME OVER + unlimited continue** (per user request). Lives reach 0 → state transitions to `GAME_OVER` (no auto-restart). Renderer paints `GAME OVER` centered red 48 px + `Press any key to continue / 아무 키나 눌러 계속`. Listening for jump (Z/Space), attack (X), sprint (X), or movement (←/→ / A/D) → `state.continueRun()` refills lives, sets `_stageRestartPending`, re-enters RESPAWNING. StageManager rebuilds the stage. Unlimited retries.
- **Rock = stumble + small vitality drain + walk-through** (per user request). Rocks no longer block hero motion. `CollisionSystem` records overlap on `level._heroRockContacts`; HeroController consumes the contacts and triggers stumble FSM:
  - `pl.stumbleFrames = 30`, vitality −10, `pl.aiState = 'stumble'`, `v.vx *= 0.3` (momentum loss)
  - During stumble: input ignored, gravity normal
  - 30-frame cooldown + per-rock token (`pl._lastRockTripKey = "col,row"`) prevents re-trip on the same rock until Reed walks fully off
- **`pl.dyingFrames` and `pl.stumbleFrames`** added to the player ECS component (additive — see PR body).

### Files touched

- 16 files; +457 / −53 lines (PR #23) + 8 files; +1060 / −21 (design PR #22)
- Briefly: `src/physics/CollisionSystem.js`, `src/mechanics/{HeroController, CombatSystem, TriggerSystem}.js`, `src/levels/{StageManager, LevelManager, TileMap, area1/index.js, area1/round-1-{1..4}.js}.js`, `src/core/StateManager.js`, `src/graphics/Renderer.js`, `src/config/PhaseTwoTunables.js`, `game.js`, `assets/sprites/hero-reed.js` (new keys), `assets/tiles/area1.js` (mile_4)

### What did NOT change

- Cast identity (Reed Bramblestep, Mossplodder, Hummerwing, dawn-husk, stone hatchet, mile-markers, boundary cairn, "The Mossline Path"). v0.50.1's lives system stays intact.
- Round terrain/spawn data (only mile-marker col positions shifted; everything else identical).
- CI workflow + bilingual policy.
- README control table (Z=jump / X=tap-throw, X-hold-sprint / Z+X-higher-jump unchanged).

### Known limitations carried to v0.75

- Stage transition between Areas (Area 2) still unbuilt; equipment-carries-to-Stage-2 remains structural-only.
- `PhysicsEngine.update` no-ops in Phase 2 mode (negligible CPU cost).
- No in-browser smoke ran during v0.50.2 dev (workstation lacked Node / `npx serve`); CI's `node --check` covers parse correctness, live URL is the first real run.
- Step-up clearance check only verifies the blocking column; entities wider than one tile could miss a wall in the unchecked column. Reed is one tile wide — non-issue today, but future entity sizes need re-validation.

### PRs in this patch

- #22 `design(v0.50.2): hero sprint + stumble + refined death + mile_4 tile (EN+KO)`
- #23 `dev(v0.50.2): jitter fix + slope step-up + new anims + mile-marker shift + death FSM + rock stumble`
- next: `chore(release): v0.50.2 release docs` (this PR family — brief Changelog + release-notes)
- next: `release(v0.50.2): patch quartile merge` (the develop→main merge)

### Tribute posture

All v0.50.2 changes apply to original characters introduced in v0.50 (Reed Bramblestep, Mossplodder, Hummerwing). The added behaviours — death-knockback animations, signpost-at-round-start, GAME OVER + continue, stumble obstacles, slope step-up — are universal platformer conventions executed with original art and original code. No reproduction of copyrighted material.

## v0.50.1 — Phase 2 patch: continuous Area 1 + 3-lives + smooth slope + X-modifier + animation tuning

**Released:** 2026-05-10 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.50.1` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

User feedback after browser-testing v0.50 surfaced four directional pivots. v0.50.1 lands all four in one dev PR.

### Fixes

- **Animation jitter / "shaky character" eliminated.** Two root causes addressed:
  - Per-anim fps override added to the sprite META contract. `hero-reed.js` now ships `idle` / `idle_armed` / `dead` at 4 fps for breathy stillness while keeping `walk` / `attack` at 8 fps for snap. `enemy-hummerwing.js` dropped from 12 → 9 fps to tame wing-flap strobe.
  - `slope_up_22` collapsed to a smooth 1-px linear ramp (matching `slope_up_45`'s shape, just shipped at the same gentleness via tile art rather than collision). The previous 4-step 12-px stair was the source of the "vibration" feel on uphill traversal.
- **Area 1 is now ONE continuous 224-column stage.** The four rounds are still authored separately (`src/levels/area1/round-1-{1..4}.js`) and concatenated by `buildArea1Stage()` in `src/levels/area1/index.js`. Mile-marker tiles stay in-world but no longer trigger fade-to-black — they fire a 90-frame bilingual `Round 1-2` / `라운드 1-2` overlay (and 1-3 / 1-4) and serve as checkpoint anchors. The boundary cairn at the far end fires the existing `Stage Cleared` overlay.
- **Hatchet pickup persists for the whole stage** (Q6 reversal). Only the round-1 dawn-husk remains in Area 1; rounds 2-4 dawn-husks dropped during concat. Once Reed picks up the hatchet, he stays armed across mid-stage respawns and (structurally) across stage transitions to future areas.
- **Lives system (3 lives) replaces single-life-line.** Vitality is treated as ONE life. Any death (vitality 0, enemy contact, fire, dart) calls `state.loseLife()` → vitality refills, lives decrements, Reed respawns at the latest mile-marker (or stage start if not yet reached) with `pl.armed` preserved. Zero lives → lives refill to 3, stage rebuilds from scratch (entities re-spawn, hero starts unarmed). Infinite retries; `GAME_OVER` is no longer reachable in Phase 2.
- **Heart HUD top-right** showing `state.lives` of `state.maxLives`. Vitality bar stays top-center as the in-life pressure clock.
- **Mile-marker = checkpoint** (mid-stage respawn anchor). Crossing a marker also refills vitality — small reward beat without a forced fade.
- **X is now dual-mode** (`PhaseTwoTunables.HERO_P2.sprintMultiplier = 1.4`, `sprintJumpMultiplier = 1.15`):
  - `X` tap = throw hatchet (existing).
  - `X` held = sprint while horizontal-moving (1.4× walk speed).
  - `Z` (jump) while `X` held = higher jump (initial vy × 1.15).
  - Phase 1 retro debug path unchanged (no sprint).

### Engine additions / changes

- **Modified**: `src/core/{StateManager, InputHandler}.js` (lives / `loseLife()` / `RESPAWNING` state / `sprintHeld` getter), `src/levels/{StageManager, LevelManager}.js` (continuous-stage load + checkpoint respawn + overlay timer), `src/levels/area1/index.js` (concatenation), `src/mechanics/{HeroController, CombatSystem, HatchetSystem, TriggerSystem}.js` (sprint + respawn flow + lives routing + overlay fire), `src/physics/CollisionSystem.js` (smoothed slope), `src/graphics/Renderer.js` (animFps overrides + lives HUD + mile-marker overlay), `src/config/PhaseTwoTunables.js` (sprint multipliers), `assets/sprites/{hero-reed, enemy-hummerwing}.js` (animFps map / META.fps tweak), `game.js` (wire the new flow).

### Files touched

- 15 files; +574 / -222 lines (PR #19).

### What did NOT change

- Cast identity (Reed Bramblestep, Mossplodder, Hummerwing, dawn-husk, stone hatchet, mile-markers, boundary cairn, "The Mossline Path"). Sprite modules and tile module unchanged in shape; only `META.animFps` / `META.fps` tweaks.
- Round data layouts — slope/enemy/decoration positions identical to v0.50.
- `docs/briefs/phase2-areas.md` and `phase2-cast-revision.md` body — only Changelog sections appended.
- CI workflow + bilingual policy.

### Known limitations carried to v0.75

- No round-card animation polish beyond the 90-frame overlay (dim strip + bilingual text fade).
- Equipment-carries-to-Stage-2 is structural-only (no Stage 2 yet); the carryover bit lives in StageManager but is unexercised.
- `PhysicsEngine.update` still runs every tick in Phase 2 mode but no-ops on every entity type. Negligible CPU.
- No in-browser smoke ran during v0.50.1 dev (workstation lacked Node / `npx serve`); CI's `node --check` covers parse, live URL is the first real run.

### PRs in this patch

### Tribute posture

All v0.50.1 changes apply to original characters introduced in v0.50 (Reed Bramblestep, Mossplodder, Hummerwing). The added mechanics — multi-screen stage with internal landmarks, lives + checkpoints, sprint/jump-modifier, animation fps tuning — are universal platformer conventions executed with original art and original code. No reproduction of copyrighted material.

## v0.50 — Phase 2: Area 1 with 4 rounds, slopes, egg→hatchet pickup, Mossplodder + Hummerwing, forest parallax

**Released:** 2026-05-09 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.50` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

The second quartile pivots from a single test stage to a real Area→Round structure with classic platformer pacing. The cast is rebuilt: Phase 1's Crawlspine / Glassmoth / Bristlecone Sapling step aside (sprite modules retained as reserve) and Area 1 introduces **Mossplodder** (slow forward-only ground crawler) and **Hummerwing** (forward-only low-altitude flier). Reed now starts each round unarmed and acquires a **stone hatchet** by running into a **dawn-husk** egg.

### What's playable

- **Area 1 — "The Mossline Path"** with four multi-screen scrolling rounds (1-1 ≈ 3 screens · 1-2 ≈ 4 screens · 1-3 ≈ 3 screens · 1-4 ≈ 4 screens). Mile-marker tile at the end of rounds 1-3; boundary cairn at the end of round 4 fires a "Stage Cleared" overlay reading `The path continues — soon.` / `길은 이어진다 — 곧.`
- **Slope-based terrain** — gentle (22°-feel) and steep (45°) ramps replace stacked platforms. Reed's feet pin to the slope profile; rocks block horizontally; jump gaps are jumpable.
- **Egg → hatchet pickup** — Reed spawns unarmed each round. About one screen in, a `dawn-husk` egg sits on the ground; running into it cracks it (3-frame break) and spawns a hatchet pickup. Walking over the pickup arms Reed (X now throws). Hatchet trajectory: parabolic, **no bounce**, 2-on-screen cap, despawn on first solid contact.
- **Animated tile rendering** — `fire_low` is the project's first animated tile, flicker at ~8 fps via the new `TileCache` infrastructure. Contract extension shipped in design PR #15 supports any future animated tile via the same `{frames, fps}` shape.
- **3-layer SVG parallax forest** — sky (factor 0), distant ridge (0.3), near foliage (0.7). Drawn beneath tiles, scrolls with camera.
- **Vitality + 1-hit-kill from v0.25.2 unchanged.** Z = jump (+ Space), X = attack. Mile-marker contact triggers fade-out / fade-in round transition (60-frame total). Mossplodder + fire = Mossplodder dies. Mossplodder + Reed = Reed dies. Hummerwing + Reed = Reed dies.

### Engine additions / changes

- **New modules**: `src/config/PhaseTwoTunables.js`, `src/graphics/TileCache.js`, `src/levels/StageManager.js`, `src/levels/area1/{round-1-1,round-1-2,round-1-3,round-1-4,index}.js`, `src/mechanics/{HatchetSystem,HuskSystem,Phase2EnemyAI,TriggerSystem}.js`.
- **Modified**: `game.js` (Phase 2 wiring), `src/levels/LevelManager.js` (new `loadAreaRound` path delegating to StageManager), `src/levels/TileMap.js` (slope/decoration/animated/trigger types + `slopeProfile` per-cell), `src/physics/CollisionSystem.js` (slope-aware floor pinning + decoration AABB), `src/graphics/Renderer.js` (TileCache draw, decoration overlay, transition fade, stage-clear overlay, armed-state anim picker), `src/graphics/ParallaxBackground.js` (3-SVG forest), `src/mechanics/{HeroController,CombatSystem}.js` (armed/unarmed state, fire-tile damage, Mossplodder + fire interaction).
- **Phase 1 retired-but-reserved**: `assets/sprites/{enemy-crawlspine,enemy-glassmoth,enemy-bristlecone-sapling,projectile-stoneflake}.js` retained on disk; not loaded by `game.js`'s active Phase 2 path. `src/mechanics/{StoneflakeSystem,SeeddartSystem}.js` retained for the Phase 1 retro debug loader.
- **CI required-files list** extended in `.github/workflows/pr-feature-to-develop.yml` to lock the new Phase 2 source files.

### Known limitations / minor issues (carry to v0.75 backlog)

- `slope_up_22` traversal is a **stepped** climb (12 px stair every 12 px of horizontal travel) — readable but not silky-smooth. Documented as intentional v0.50 trade-off in `src/physics/CollisionSystem.js`; revisit for true 22° (per-pixel ramp) in v0.75.
- Round 1-3's 3-tile gap (cols 6-8) sits at the edge of Reed's max jump distance; tunable `HERO.jumpVy0` is the knob if playtest reports it feels punishing.
- Round transition shows fade only — no "Round 1-2" text card. Intentional for v0.50 minimum-viable; UI polish in v0.75.
- Hummerwing dead body falls to the level-row boundary, not the actual ground tile under it (cosmetic — most visible only when a Hummerwing dies over a gap).
- `PhysicsEngine.update` runs every tick in Phase 2 mode but no-ops on every entity type (Phase 1 hero, axe projectile, patrol enemy). Negligible CPU; safe to leave.
- Stage Clear is terminal — refresh to retry. Continue/restart deferred to v0.75 mechanics work.
- **No in-browser smoke ran during dev**: workstation lacked Node / `npx serve`. Static checks (paren/brace balance, import resolution, matrix-dimension validation) all green; CI's `node --check` covers parse errors. Live URL post-deploy is the first real run.

### PRs in this quartile

### Tribute posture

All v0.50 art, audio, names, world fiction, and code are original to this project. The Mossplodder, Hummerwing, dawn-husk, stone hatchet, mile-marker, boundary cairn, and "The Mossline Path" are coined for this work. Generic platformer mechanics (4-round stages, slope terrain, item pickup, throwable axe, snail-archetype + bee-archetype enemies, forest theme + rock/fire obstacles) are universal — original execution preserves the tribute posture.

## v0.25.2 — Phase 1 patch: HP removal + Z/X key bindings

**Released:** 2026-05-09 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.25.2` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

User feedback after v0.25.1's browser smoke pointed at a structural overlap (HP
hearts + Vitality bar both tracking life) and an awkward jump-key choice. v0.25.2
collapses Phase 1 to a single life-line and switches to Z/X for jump/attack.

### Fixes

- **HP system removed.** No more hp/iframes/hurt-lock/knockback. Any contact
  with a damaging enemy state, any enemy projectile hit, or vitality reaching
  zero triggers an immediate game over. Vitality is the single life-line.
- **HP heart HUD removed**; only the Vitality bar remains.
- **Jump moved to Z key** (Space kept as accessibility alternate). `↑` and `W`
  no longer jump — they were colliding with players' D-pad expectations.
- **Attack tightened to X only** (Ctrl dropped — was colliding with browser
  shortcuts on some setups).
- **Double-init bug fixed (root cause for "stuck camera" + "ghost player at spawn").**
  `game.js` registered `init` on click, keydown, and touchstart with
  `{once: true}`. Each listener removed only itself after firing, so the user
  clicked to start (firing init), then pressed an arrow key (firing init
  AGAIN). The second init re-ran `loadPhase1Test()` and spawned a second
  player entity at the spawn position, overwriting `levelManager.playerEntity`
  to point at the stationary one — which stalled camera follow (issue 3) and
  left a visible ghost at the spawn (issue 4). Added a function-level
  `_initFired` guard plus explicit `removeEventListener` calls for the sibling
  listeners. Single source of init.
- **Sapling closed-state still 0 damage** — design intent preserved even with
  1-hit-kill.
- `docs/briefs/phase1-cast.md` gets a **Changelog section** documenting the
  hp/iframes pivot and key-binding change.

### Files touched

- `src/core/InputHandler.js`, `src/core/StateManager.js`,
  `src/mechanics/HeroController.js`, `src/mechanics/CombatSystem.js`,

- `docs/briefs/phase1-cast.md` (Changelog section)

### What did NOT change

- Cast identity (Reed Bramblestep + Crawlspine + Glassmoth + Bristlecone
  Sapling), sprite modules, palette, FSM topology.
- Camera scroll, animation timing, enemy feel tunings (all from v0.25.1 stay).
- CI workflow, deploy pipeline, branch strategy.

## v0.25.1 — Phase 1 patch: input edge fix + animation timing + scrollable stage + enemy feel

**Released:** 2026-05-09 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.25.1` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

Browser smoke after v0.25 surfaced four issues. v0.25.1 addresses all four in a single dev-lead patch (PR #8) plus a small release-notes update (this PR).

### Fixes

- **Input edge detection unblocked.** `GameLoop._update` was calling `input.update()` before any system read input, so `_prev` always equalled `_keys` and `isPressed`/`isReleased` permanently returned false. Effect: stoneflake throws (`X`), buffered jump trigger, and pause toggle all silently no-op'd. Reordered so input snapshots happen at the END of the frame; mechanics also runs while paused (so unpause can fire), then physics/level/audio gate on `state.gameState !== 'PAUSED'`.
- **Animation timing locked to simulation rate, with state-aware reset.** Renderer's animation index used a render-rate frame counter, so high-Hz monitors played sprites 2.4–4× too fast and idle↔walk↔jump transitions popped into mid-cycle frames. New `Renderer.tick()` (driven by `GameLoop._update`) advances a `_simFrame` counter at the fixed 60 Hz step. Per-sprite `_animStartFrame` resets when the resolved animation key changes; same pattern for the attack overlay so a fresh throw starts at frame 0.
- **Test stage now scrolls.** TestStage extended from 16×12 to **32×12 tiles** with six platforms (three high, three low) and six enemies spread across the stage. Phase-1 mode in `LevelManager.update` now runs the same camera lerp the legacy path uses (player ~1/3 from the left, clamped to stage edges), while still skipping the legacy `_check{Items,Enemies,Hazards,Goal}` paths since CombatSystem owns those.
- **Enemy feel retuned for classic-platformer rhythm.** Tunables-only changes; no design or sprite changes:
  - **Crawlspine** — `walkSpeed 1.0 → 0.8`, `turnFrames 6 → 12` (visible turn beat).
  - **Glassmoth** — gentler bob (`driftAmplitude 16 → 24`, `driftFrequency 0.06 → 0.04`), slower swoop with longer commit and recover (`swoopVy 4.0 → 3.2`, `swoopFrames 24 → 30`, `recoverFrames 30 → 50`), hero must be closer (`sightRangeX 240 → 200`).
  - **Bristlecone Sapling** — clearer telegraph (`closedFrames 120 → 150`, `windupFrames 12 → 24`, `firingFrames 4 → 6`, `cooldownFrames 90 → 120`).
  - **Seeddart** — `speed 4.0 → 3.4` (more dodgeable).
- **Pause/unpause fix bundled in.** Latent `_update` early-return on PAUSED meant the pause input could never fire to unpause. Now pause-toggle survives both edges.

### What did NOT change

- No new ECS components or fields.
- No sprite, palette, or asset edits.
- No story, design, or world-fiction edits.
- HERO and STONEFLAKE tunable blocks unchanged from v0.25.
- CI workflow unchanged (already fixed in #7).
- Legacy Area-1 path unchanged.

### Files touched

- `src/core/GameLoop.js`, `src/graphics/Renderer.js`, `src/levels/TestStage.js`, `src/levels/LevelManager.js`, `src/config/PhaseOneTunables.js`, `game.js`

## v0.25 — Phase 1: cast and combat skeleton

**Released:** 2026-05-09 (planned)
**Tag:** `v0.25` on `main`
**Pages:** https://genishs.github.io/wonderboy/

### What's playable
- Original hero **Reed Bramblestep** spawns on a single hand-coded test stage and responds to keyboard input.
- Walk with momentum, variable-height jump (hold-to-go-higher, release-to-cut), coyote frames + buffered jump.
- Throwable original weapon **stoneflake** — skipping-stone arc, single bounce, ≤2 on-screen, walk-throw and jump-throw both work.
- Three mechanically distinct original enemies on the test stage:
  - **Crawlspine** — ground crawler that walks-and-turns at edges and walls (contact damage).
  - **Glassmoth** — airborne sine-drifter that swoops when the hero comes within ~5 tiles below, then recovers (damage on swoop only).
  - **Bristlecone Sapling** — stationary timed hazard cycling closed → windup → firing → cooldown; emits a 3-dart fan at firing; closed silhouette is harmless.
- Hero hurt FSM with iframes, knockback, blink-on-hit; HP bar HUD; terminal Game Over at HP 0.
- All sprites rendered from original Design pixel modules via the Phase 1 SpriteCache (no PNG assets, no scraped art).

### Engine additions
- New modules under `src/`: `config/PhaseOneTunables.js`, `graphics/SpriteCache.js`, `levels/TestStage.js`, `mechanics/{HeroController,EnemyAI,StoneflakeSystem,SeeddartSystem,CombatSystem}.js`.
- ECS field additions (no new components): see PR #4 body for the exact list.
- Single-source-of-truth tunables file lets one-knob playtest tuning happen in one place.

### Known limitations (carried into v0.50 backlog)
- Game Over is terminal — no in-game restart; refresh the page to retry.
- The legacy `Vitality` bar still renders at the top-center of the HUD; Phase 1 entities don't consume hunger so the bar drains harmlessly. To be removed or repurposed when Phase 3 mechanics ship.
- The legacy Area-1 `loadLevel(1, …)` path is unreachable from `game.js` but still builds; bee/cobra/frog enemies will need an AI gate revisit when Phase 2 reactivates the legacy path.
- No camera scroll, no parallax, no audio integration in this quartile (deferred to v0.50 / v0.75).
- `node` was unavailable on the authoring workstation; CI (GitHub Actions) covers `node --check` on every PR.
